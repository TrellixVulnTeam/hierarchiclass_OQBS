"Cornelio Saavedra Rodríguez (1821 – April 7, 1891) was a Chilean politician and military figure who played a major role in the Occupation of the Araucanía. His parents were Manuel Saavedra Cabrera, son of the president of the First Government of Buenos Aires in 1810 and Argentine general, Cornelio Saavedra, and Josefina Rodriguez Salcedo. He married Dorotea Rivera Serrano, daughter of Chilean General Juan de Dios Rivera and Freire de Andrade and Galeazzo Maria del Rosario Alfaro Serrano. At the age of 15 years he entered the military academy, graduating with the rank of second lieutenant of infantry in the Chilean Army in the following year. In 1837 he was assigned to Battalion Chillán, where he rose to lieutenant at the age of 17 years. In 1847 he was promoted to the rank of sergeant major and retired from active duty for health reasons in 1849. Two years later he was called to participate in the 1851 Revolution to overthrow the newly elected President Manuel Montt and to repeal the 1833 Constitution. In 1857 he was appointed mayor and commander of weapons of Arauco, in whose care had to quell the uprising of the southern provinces during the revolution of 1859. That year he was reinstated to the Army with the rank of sergeant major. Cornelio Saavedra Rodríguez took office as General Commander of the Chilean Navy in 1860, but left the charge the same year. In 1862 he was promoted to lieutenant colonel. Saavedra presented a draft plan to President Manuel Montt to advance Chilean territory to the south of La Frontera (consisting of the Bio Bio River), a plan that was rejected. After the incident involving the Frenchman Orélie-Antoine de Tounens, self-proclaimed King of the Araucania and Patagonia declaring the territories of his \""kingdom\"" under the protection of France, President José Joaquín Pérez Mascayano decided to occupy the area immediately approving Saavedra's plan for the occupation of the Araucanía during its first phase.. He led campaigns culminating in the submission of the Mapuche. The first phase consisted of building forts and small villages along the river Malleco, going into Mapuche territory (including the foundation of the city of Angol in 1862). The second phase (1867–1869) was decisive in advance, but the third phase in 1870 was not as successful and led to further negotiations. After the pacification of Araucanía, he participated in the War of the Pacific. He later retired from military life was made a deputy for San Carlos, Chile (1861–1864), Linares, Chile (1864–1867), Carelmapu (1867–1870), Nacimiento, Chile and Angol (1870–1873) and Minister of War (1879).",MilitaryPerson

"Gentō Sokuchū (Japanese: 玄透即中) was a Sōtō Zen priest and the 50th abbot of Eihei-ji, the school's head temple. He was part of a 17th and 18th century movement within the Sōtō school that sought to bring the school's teachings back in line with those of the 13th century founding teacher, Dōgen. To this end, he edited major editions of works by Dōgen and succeeded in disseminating them widely. He is best remembered for compiling the Eihei Rules of Purity (Eihei Shingi), a collection of writings by Dōgen laying out a strict code of conduct for monks. These rules had been largely unheeded in the school in the preceding several centuries, and Gentō used his high position as abbot of Eihei-ji to reintroduce and enforce them. His work on the Eihei Rules of Purity was completed in 1794 while he was serving as the eleventh abbot of Entsū-ji. The following year he became the 50th abbot of Eihei-ji. He was also involved in editing Dōgen's master work, the Shōbōgenzō. In addition to his efforts on monastic rules, he also sought to remove what he perceived to be non-Sōtō elements within the school. He de-emphasized the use of koans due to their apparent historical association with the competing Rinzai school. In 1796 he also had the sangha hall (sōdō, 僧堂) at Eihei-ji rebuilt in imitation of the Song Dynasty structures that Dōgen had described. The previous building, dating from only fifty years earlier, was built in a Ming Dynasty style based on temples of the recently introduced Ōbaku school. Gentō's former student at Entsū-ji was the famous wandering monk Ryōkan. The Buddhist scholar Michel Mohr suggests that Gentō's fanaticism for 'purifying' the Sōtō school probably informed Ryōkan's decision to become an itinerant monk without an association to any temple.",Religious

"Arvandus was a Gaul who rose through the hierarchy of Imperial Roman society to twice be appointed Praetorian prefect of Gaul. On the first occasion, 461, he was appointed by Emperor Libius Severus. This appointment ended when Severus died in 465. Two years later, in 467, he was appointed by Anthemius. His friend and chronicler, Sidonius Apollinaris, records that his first term was successful and he himself well liked. However, in his second term he found himself widely hated, and in 472 was removed from office and brought to Rome in chains. Here he was accused by envoys from a commission of influential Gauls of committing treason. The envoys brought with them a letter which Arvandus' secretary attested had been dictated by Arvandus. In it, Arvandus set out to dissuade Euric, king of the Visigoths, from concluding peace with the Eastern Roman Emperor, urging that instead he should attack the Bretons north of the Loire. The letter asserted that the Law of Nations called for a division of Gaul between the Visigoths and Burgundians. Riothamus, King of the Britons, was allied to Roman Emperor Anthemius, so this was tantamount to declaring war on the Emperor. Arvandus was put on trial for treason. The trial should have been overseen by Sidonius, but Sidonius chose to resign his position instead, and plead for clemency on behalf of his friend. At his trial, Arvandus was found guilty and was stripped on the spot of all the privileges pertaining to his prefecture, and consigned to the common jail to await execution. Cassiodorus asserts that Arvandus' intention was to divide the empire and seize the throne: It may be that Arvandus was hoping to obtain the throne with aid from the Gauls and the Visigoths, in the manner of the previous attempt by Avitus. If so, Arvandus was disappointed; he received no support from the Gallic aristocracy. Possibly this was a result of his undistinguished birth, but the great majority of the Gauls would have learned from Avitus' example, and realized that the day for such adventures was long past. Cassiodorius reports that Sidonius and his friends were successful in saving Arvandus from the death penalty. \""At the order of Anthemius, Arvandus, who had attempted to become emperor, was sent into exile\"" (\""Arabundus imperium temptans iussu Anthemii exilio deportatur\"".",MilitaryPerson

"Samuel Sherwood was High Constable of the Toronto Police Department from 1852 to 1859. A tavern owner with ties to the Tory Family Compact, his brother, Henry Sherwood was Mayor of Toronto and then Premier of Canada West in the 1840s. According to Conyngham Crawford Taylor, Samuel Sherwood was “a quiet, good-natured man, who did not insist on any strict regulations as to the dress or discipline of the men. They wore a uniform, but without uniformity, except in one respect—they were universally slovenly.” His stewardship of the police force was accordingly lax. Most officers were Orangemen, at a time when Toronto was riven by religious sectarianism between the more affluent Protestant majority and the poorer Catholic minority, and showed favouritism to other members of the Orange Order, even to the point of joining them in brawling with Catholics in the six major instances of sectarian rioting between 1852 and 1858. In March 1858, Sherwood himself refused to testify against a fellow Orangeman implicated in rioting at the St Patrick's Day parade. Sherwood was appointed chief constable despite the fact that a provincial inquiry had implicated him in the 1841 election riot that followed his brother's electoral defeat that year. Sherwood had allegedly organized an armed gang inside the Coleraine Tavern which opened fire upon participants in the rival candidate's victory parade. In 1858, Sherwood let the prime suspect in the robbery of the Bank of Upper Canada go free prompting the mayor, William Henry Boulton, to order an inquiry. Sherwood quarreled with Boulton in the press, accusing him of running a star chamber proceeding against him, resulting in Boulton recommending Sherwood's suspension to city council. Council voted 14 to 10 in favour of Sherwood resulting in Boulton resigning as mayor, though he ran in the subsequent election. The scandal resulted in provincial legislation that required the appointment of an independent police board. The body, the Toronto Board of Police Commissioners was appointed in 1859 and fired Sherwood and the entire police force in order to replace them with a better trained, disciplined force. Sherwood went on to be Toronto's harbour master.",OfficeHolder

Often associated with Structural Realists like Kenneth Waltz and Stephan Walt, he may more accurately be portrayed as a Neoclassical Realist (a term coined by Gideon Rose) because of his willingness to consider non-structural explanations of state behavior (other neoclassical realists include Fareed Zakaria, Thomas J. Christensen, and William Wohlforth). For instance: Randall Schweller and David Priess, \""A Tale of Two Realisms: Expanding the Institutions Debate,\"" Mershon International Studies Review 41:2 (April 1997) He is also credited with reemphasizing the distinction between status-quo and revisionist states, and incorporating that difference into realist theories of state behavior.

He began his career as a Minister of the Church of Scotland but ceased to be a Minister (or called 'Reverend') when he was given a professorship at King's College, Aberdeen in 1752. He obtained his doctorate and wrote An Inquiry Into the Human Mind on the Principles of Common Sense (published in 1764). He and his colleagues founded the 'Aberdeen Philosophical Society' which was popularly known as the 'Wise Club' (a literary-philosophical association). Shortly after the publication of his first book, he was given the prestigious Professorship of Moral Philosophy at the University of Glasgow when he was called to replace Adam Smith. He resigned from this position in 1781, after which he prepared his university lectures for publication in two books: Essays on the Intellectual Powers of Man (1785) and Essays on the Active Powers of the Human Mind (1788). Reid was buried at Blackfriars Church in the grounds of Glasgow College and when the university moved to Gilmorehill in the west of Glasgow, his tombstone was inserted in the main building. See separate article on Thomas Reid's tombstone. Reid believed that common sense (in a special philosophical sense of sensus communis) is, or at least should be, at the foundation of all philosophical inquiry. He disagreed with Hume, who asserted that we can never know what an external world consists of as our knowledge is limited to the ideas in the mind, and George Berkeley, who asserted that the external world is merely ideas in the mind. By contrast, Reid claimed that the foundations upon which our sensus communis are built justify our belief that there is an external world. In his day and for some years into the 19th century, he was regarded as more important than Hume. He advocated direct realism, or common sense realism, and argued strongly against the Theory of Ideas advocated by John Locke, René Descartes, and (in varying forms) nearly all Early Modern philosophers who came after them. He had a great admiration for Hume and had a mutual friend send Hume an early manuscript of Reid's Inquiry. Hume responded that the \""deeply philosophical\"" work \""is wrote in a lively and entertaining matter,\"" but that \""there seems to be some defect in method,\"" and criticized Reid for implying the presence of innate ideas.",Philosopher

"José Renan Vasconcelos Calheiros (Portuguese pronunciation: [ʁeˈnɐ̃ kaˈʎejɾus]; born in Murici, Alagoas, on September 16, 1955) is a Brazilian politician and current President of the Senate of Brazil, for the fourth time. He has represented the state of Alagoas in the senate for the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party since 1 February 1995. On May 25, 2007, Veja magazine accused Calheiros of accepting funds from a lobbyist to pay for the child support of a daughter from a previous extramarital affair with journalist Monica Veloso. In trying to justify the origin of the funds, subsequent investigations on Calheiros' business dealings led to other revelations about income tax fraud and the use of a proxy to buy a stake in a radio station. Calheiros was subject to a disciplinary inquiry by the senate's ethics committee on four different counts. On September 12, 2007, the senate voted by secret ballot against impeaching Calheiros on the lobby funds accusation. He is still facing three separate inquiries on other charges. After the vote, the public outrage which followed forced congress to eliminate secret ballot votes for ethics violation, meaning Calheiros' three other inquiries, if approved by the ethics committee, will be subject to an open ballot vote in the senate floor. On October 11, 2007, Calheiros stepped down as president of the senate, taking a 45-day leave of absence from the position. The ethics inquiries will continue to progress through the senate committees. Calheiros worked for both the Fernando Collor de Mello and Fernando Henrique Cardoso governments. On February 1, 2013, he was again elected president of the Brazilian Senate. Due to the accusations mentioned above, many Brazilians became upset about his election and some started an online petition demanding Renan's impeachment.

"Lt.-Colonel The Hon. Arthur Trefusis Heneage Williams (June 13, 1837 – July 4, 1885) was a Canadian businessman, farmer and political figure. His statue stands in front of the town hall of Port Hope, Ontario. Born at Penryn Park, Port Hope in Upper Canada in 1837, a member of the Williams family of Caerhays and Burncoose. He was the eldest son of John Tucker Williams and his wife Sarah, daughter of Judge Thomas Ward (1770–1861) of Port Hope. He studied at Upper Canada College and the University of Edinburgh before travelling throughout Europe. He studied law but was not called to the bar, instead he 'delighted in calling himself a farmer', managing Penryn Park, the estate he'd inherited from his father. He was president and founder of the Midlands Loan and Savings Company and a director for the Midland Railway of Canada. In politics he represented Durham East in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1867 to 1874 and in the Canadian House of Commons as a Conservative member from 1879 to 1885. Williams was captain in the local militia, later becoming lieutenant-colonel. In 1885, he led the Midland Battalion which helped put down the Northwest Rebellion. Shortly after the Battle of Batoche, he became ill and died of fever on a steamboat on the North Saskatchewan River in 1885. The Dictionary of Canadian Biography writes, Colonel Williams was the only nationally known figure to die in the northwest campaign and his body was brought home in state. A huge funeral was held in Port Hope where citizens erected a statue in his honour. Parliament voted his orphaned children a special pension. Then, like most heroes, he was gradually forgotten. To Charles Arkoll Boulton, a contemporary, Williams “represented what might be termed Young Canada”; to posterity, he reflects a model of the patriotic landed gentleman, using his wealth and position for dignified public service, accepting payment in the currency of honour and prestige. In short, Arthur Williams was an anachronism. Williams married Emily, the daughter of Senator Benjamin Seymour of Port Hope. They were the parents of General Arthur Victor Seymour Williams.

"The military career of Benedict Arnold in 1781 consisted of service in the British Army. Arnold had changed sides in September 1780, after his plot to surrender the key Continental Army outpost at West Point was exposed. After spending the rest of 1780 recruiting Loyalists for a new regiment called the American Legion, Arnold was sent with 1,600 men in late December by General Sir Henry Clinton to Virginia, with instructions to raid Richmond and then establish a strong fortification at Portsmouth. Landing in Virginia on January 4, 1781, he raided Richmond the next day. After raiding a few nearby communities, he returned to Portsmouth, where his troops established fortifications. They remained there until late March, when 2,000 reinforcements led by General William Phillips arrived. Phillips took command of the forces, and Arnold served under him as they resumed raiding operations aimed at potentially establishing a permanent presence at Richmond. Although they fought off a spirited militia defense in the Battle of Blandford in late April, the timely arrival of Continental forces under the Marquis de Lafayette prevented the taking of Richmond. Phillips continued to raid, but was ordered to Petersburg to effect a junction with General Charles Cornwallis, who was marching up from North Carolina. Phillips died on May 13 of a fever, and Arnold was briefly in command again until Cornwallis arrived a week later. Arnold returned to New York, suffering from a recurrence of gout. When French and American movements to encircle Cornwallis at Yorktown became apparent to General Clinton, he sent Arnold on a raiding expedition in early September to New London, Connecticut in an attempt to draw American resources away from Virginia. Arnold raided the port, but a detachment of his troops was involved in the bloody Battle of Groton Heights at a fort across the Thames River. The operation was the last command Arnold held. In December, he and General Cornwallis, who had been released on parole after his surrender at Yorktown, sailed for England. During his command of British troops, Arnold did not command a great deal of respect from other officers. His actions in Virginia and Connecticut were criticized, and allegations that he was primarily interested in money circulated in New York.

"Truman Smith Baxter (November 24, 1867 – October 27, 1931) was the 16th mayor of Vancouver, British Columbia. He was born on a farm near Carlingford, Ontario, part of Fullertown Township in Perth County. He was the son of Richard and Elizabeth Baxter, the former a native of Ontario, and the latter of Cornwall, England. The paternal grandfather came from New York to Ontario at the time of the American Revolutionary War, being numbered among the United Empire Loyalists. Truman was educated in the public schools in Perth County Ontario and then attended High School in Stratford Ontario. His mother, Elizabeth died when he was fourteen years old. His father Richard continued farming until his retirement in 1907 when he moved to Toronto. After graduation, Truman took up the profession of teaching, which he practiced for three years in Ontario. In the spring of 1890, at the age of 23, he moved to Vancouver. His first position was in the Leamy & Kyle mill on False creek, one of the city's first sawmills, often referred to as the \""Red Mill\"". After a time he went to the Royal City Planing Mills, and later the Heaps mill on False creek which was later destroyed by fire. During his first year of residence in Vancouver he was employed grading the streets and was also a longshoreman. He then began studying for a first-class teachers certificate in connection with J.A. Fraser, who was at the time MLA for Cariboo. After obtaining the certificate he worked as a teacher in the public schools in Vancouver, eventually becoming the first assistant at Mount Pleasant School. He then studied law and five years later was called to the bar. He practiced for three years in partnership with L.B. McLellan and William Savage. In partnership with Peter Wright he purchased the furniture store of G.W. Hutchins at the corner of Main and Hastings Street, and renamed it Baxter and Wright. Baxter served on three occasions as an alderman for ward 5 in Vancouver (1900, 1905-6, 1912). In 1903, he was an unsuccessful candidate for the provincial legislature, as a Liberal. In 1913, he became mayor running as an independent, and was elected by acclamation. In 1914, he won a second term against L. D. Taylor by 2091 votes. Baxter ran on his strengths as a business administrator, arguing that he had pulled the city’s finances together out of the “financial chaos” caused by previous administrations. Baxter was said to be favoured by women voters, Taylor by working men. In 1915, he lost to Taylor by 686 votes. At Lulu Island, in 1893, Baxter married Miss Sarah Whiteside, a daughter of John Whiteside and a sister of Thomas Whiteside, who for two years also represented ward 5 in city council. They had four children together- Ernest, Fred, Harold, and Marguerite. Baxter was an enthusiastic motorist, and was one of the first car owners in British Columbia. He belonged to the Loyal Orange Lodge, and various civic and social clubs including the Vancouver Board of Trade, Progress, Terminal City, Commercial and Automobile clubs. Baxter faced not only a time of economic decline, but also the circumstances surrounding Canada's involvement with World War I. Two of his four children volunteered to serve overseas in that conflict. All civic departments were reorganized to adapt to the financial crisis and war priorities. At the outbreak of the war, city council voted a two per cent cut in pay of civil servants, but also formed a Charities and Relief Committee to look after those most in need. He worked hard to carry the Canadian Northern Railway agreement to False creek, and was successful in that effort.",OfficeHolder
"Clement Richard Attlee, 1st Earl Attlee, KG, OM, CH, PC, FRS (3 January 1883 – 8 October 1967) was a British politician who was the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1945 to 1951 and the Leader of the Labour Party from 1935 to 1955. Attlee was the first person to hold the office of Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, serving under Winston Churchill in the wartime coalition government. He went on to lead the Labour Party to a landslide election victory in summer 1945 and to a narrow victory in 1950. He became the first Labour Prime Minister ever to serve a full five-year term, as well as the first to command a Labour majority in Parliament and remains the longest-ever serving Leader of the Labour Party. First elected to Parliament in 1922 from Limehouse, Attlee rose quickly to become a junior minister in the minority government led by Ramsay MacDonald in 1924, and then joined the Cabinet during MacDonald's second ministry of 1929-31. One of only a handful of Labour frontbenchers to retain his seat in the landslide defeat of 1931, he became the party's Deputy Leader. In 1935 he became the Leader of the Party. At first advocating pacificism and appeasement, he later reversed his position and by 1938 became a strong critic of Neville Chamberlain's attempts to appease Adolf Hitler. He took Labour into the Churchill war ministry in 1940. Initially serving as Lord Privy Seal, he was appointed Deputy Prime Minister in 1942. Attlee and Churchill worked together very smoothly, with Attlee working backstage to handle much of the detail and organizational work in Parliament, as Churchill took centre stage with his attention on diplomacy, military policy, and broader issues. With victory in Europe in May 1945, the coalition government was dissolved. Attlee led Labour to win a huge majority in the ensuing 1945 general election two months later. The government he led built the post-war consensus, based upon the assumption that full employment would be maintained by Keynesian policies and that a greatly enlarged system of social services would be created – aspirations that had been outlined in the wartime Beveridge Report. Within this context, his government undertook the nationalisation of public utilities and major industries, as well as the creation of the National Health Service. Attlee himself had little interest in economic matters but this settlement was broadly accepted by all parties for three decades. During his premiership British India (India and Pakistan), Burma (Myanmar), and Ceylon (Sri Lanka) became independent. His government ended the British Mandates of Palestine and Jordan. From 1947 he pushed the United States to take a more vigorous role in the emerging Cold War against Soviet Communism. When the budgetary crisis forced Britain out of Greece in 1947 he called on Washington to counter the Communists with the Truman Doctrine. He avidly supported the Marshall Plan to rebuild Western Europe with American money. In 1949 he promoted the NATO military alliance against the Soviet bloc. He sent British troops to fight in the Malayan Emergency in 1948, and sent the RAF to participate in the Berlin Airlift. He commissioned an independent nuclear deterrent for the UK. After leading Labour to a narrow victory in the 1950 general election, he sent British troops to fight in the Korean War. Attlee was narrowly defeated by the Conservatives under Churchill in the 1951 general election. He continued as Labour leader but had lost his effectiveness by then. He retired after losing the 1955 general election, and was elevated to the House of Lords. In public, Attlee was modest and unassuming; he was ineffective at public relations and lacked charisma. His strengths emerged behind the scenes, especially in committees where his depth of knowledge, quiet demeanour, objectivity and pragmatism proved decisive. He saw himself as spokesman on behalf of his entire party, and successfully kept its multiple factions in harness. Attlee is consistently rated by scholars, critics and public as one of the greatest British Prime Ministers. His reputation among scholars in recent decades has been much higher than during his years as Prime Minister, thanks to his role in forging the welfare state and the coalition opposing Stalin in the Cold War.",OfficeHolder
