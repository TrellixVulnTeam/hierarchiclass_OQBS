She adopted the stage name Evelyn Avery, but is more often credited with her own name (the name she used when she won the Miss USA title). In 1951 she appeared in the short-lived variety show Seven at Eleven. In 1954, she was Johnny Carson\\'s assistant in the short lived game show \\\\\"Earn Your Vacation\\\\\".
